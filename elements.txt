    <!--<article><u><b>Fresh water</b></u><br>There is no physical substance humans require more than freshwater: without water we can only 
        survive a few hellish days. While pollution and overuse has threatened many of the world’s drinking
        water sources, <del>nature has an old-fashioned solution,</del> at least, to pollution. Healthy freshwater 
        ecosystems—watersheds, wetlands, and forests—naturally clean pollution and toxins from water. Soils, 
        microorganisms, and plant roots all play a role in filtering and recycling out pollutants with a price 
        far cheaper than building a water filtration plant. According to research, the more biodiverse the 
        ecosystem, the faster and more efficiently water is purified.</article>

        us. Insects, <del>birds, and even some mammals,</del> pollinate the world’s plants, including much of human 
        agriculture. Around 80% of the world’s plants require a different species to act as pollinator.
